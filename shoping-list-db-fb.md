     - Item Name (String)  
     - Quantity (Number)  
     - Category (e.g., Vegetables, Dairy, Household)  
     - Expiration Date (Date)  
     - Purchased Status (Boolean - True/False)  
   - Implement **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing grocery items:  
     - **Add a new item with category selection** (3 Marks)  
     - **Display all items** in a categorized ListView (3 Marks)  
     - **Update item details** including quantity and expiration date (3 Marks)  
     - **Delete an item from the list** (3 Marks)  
     - **Mark items as purchased/unpurchased** (3 Marks)

2. **Firebase Integration for Cloud Backup (10 Marks)**  
   - Implement Firebase Authentication for user sign-in/up using email/password.  
   - Sync grocery items with Firebase Firestore:  
     - **Upload grocery items** to Firestore for cloud backup (5 Marks)  
     - **Fetch and sync items** from Firestore to update the local SQLite database (5 Marks)

3. **Sorting and Filtering Items (5 Marks)**  
   - Implement sorting options (e.g., by category, expiration date, or quantity).  
   - Add filtering options to show items based on their category (e.g., Vegetables, Dairy).  
   - Provide an option to display only purchased or unpurchased items.

4. **Offline Data Management (5 Marks)**  
   - Ensure the app is fully functional offline using SQLite for data storage.  
   - Automatically synchronize with Firebase Firestore when the internet connection is restored.
